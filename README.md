# 2024-connectomics-hackathon

One day meeting in Cambridge focussed on API work that will maximise
the value of VFB for connectomics data users.

## coconatfly

We would like to make

* coconat key (hb:100034) to VFB_id mapper
* key -> FBbt and / or symbol

## VFB_connect

* term info lookups
  * flexible search when we have a text label which might be a synonym and we want to get some suggested VFB matches
  * take vfb_id and get FBbt and/or symbol
  * take cell type label for a given dataset/publication
